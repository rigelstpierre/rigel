The past couple of days have been intense at ICON Worldwide. We had to prepare for a big proposal and I've been playing catchup with myself. I've been working on the same basic set of projects for the past 7 weeks. They need to be wrapped up by tomorrow for a few reasons. One - they need to ship. The world needs to see them. Two - a client is expecting one on Tuesday. Three. I've got a 5 weeks left and can't believe that time has flown by so fast! It's insane where time has gone.

I've really been trying to focus. Not have twitter on, avoid checking my RSS feeds, talking in the office. Just facing forward and writing code. Today I finial got into a groove of amazing productivity and really getting done and wanted to share how I got there.

One-I moved my desk. Ever time someone walks upstairs or around upstairs I can feel the ground shake(it's a loft). It would cause me to turn around and see what's going on. Since moving my desk back to where I was when I arrived I found myself looking around a lot less.

Two-I changed how I use dual screens. To be real I hate dual screens. Today I tired something I really liked. Stacked screens(as pictured below). I setup a simple 20" inch screen above my laptop. I put my browser on top and had coda on the bottom. I really enjoyed this setup. It was great even when I was doing Wordpress integration as I could compare code easily and with just a glance instead of having to move my whole head to different part of my desk. Somehow having this setup forced me to get things done. I had less open then in a long time. It was really great. I'm not sure how I'll apply this to iOS development but it works for front-end development, better than the biggest screens I've ever worked off.

Three-I set goals and achieved those goals before moving on. When I got in this morning my mind was thinking about 4 different projects and the many tasks I had to do on them. I decided to focus on a handful instead of a fistful. I aimed to fix the major css issues, a portfolio, rebuild a LAMP server and start on a Nav. I achieved all of these things. I still have lots to do but it's much more manageable and I feel good about the progress I got done.

Four-Not throwing time at the project. I did stay late. Latter than most people had. I left the office shortly before 10:00pm. I had planned to stay all night and throw sheer time at the project hoping to get more done. I knew I was fading and I was very tired. I decided to go home, get a good nights rest and then get back it late in the morning. If I work to hard at something for too long it will never work. By taking a brain shutting my brain down and just relaxing, when I go back to the same problem I had today, odds are it will be much more clear and I'll achieve the result much quicker.

It's really odd. Friday's never have been productive for me, yet today it was nothing but productivity. I hope this continues for the next few weeks and carry it into my learning time and future jobs, what ever they maybe as well. It feels good and I'm excited about the morning but not as excited as going to sleep now.
