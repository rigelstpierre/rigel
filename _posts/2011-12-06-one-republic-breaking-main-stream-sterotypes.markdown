title: One Republic - Breaking Main Stream Sterotypes

As a geek I tend over think a lot of things, including music. Recently I've been on One Republic kick. Started with hearing Good Life on the radio and now has evolved into watching AOL Sessions. While watching these sessions I realized how stupidly talented this band is.

<p>When most 5 or 6 piece rock walk out on stage they play the same instrument for a number of hours, and walk off stage. One Republic, no they all sing, and jump all over the place depending on what's need for that song. Only need one guitar for a track? Well then the other two play the cello and violin, while the guitar player and singer cover keys.

It's been really cool to watch and listen as a lot of bands don't translate well. Mostly pop bands. One Republic translated really well and where you'd expect a whistle to be done by a backing track they even did that. It's that kinda of passion and care for craftmenship that the music industry has really been missing in the mainstream for sometime. It's honestly refreshing.

Wednesday's hat tip goes to One Republic.
