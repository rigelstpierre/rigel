Back in August I took a full time job with a really great company, Amco. I wanted to learn to work with teams and become a better rails developer. It's been a really great 6 months but it's time to move on. Today is my last day with Amco. I've learned an incredible amount from the team. From working in a team to Rails and Ruby skills. What's next, adding value.

Before I took the job at Amco, I met with the awesome team at Fifty & Fifty. At the time they weren't looking for what I was after but I still thought what they were doing was amazing. They work strictly with Non-Profits and the like. People trying to add value or make the world a better place. This is the kind of work I want to do.

I also want variety. There is something to be said for working on the same app or set of apps constantly, but another for switching things up. I love the challenge of context switching from project to project.

I'm really excited for what the future holds with the team at Fifty & Fifty. I start Monday and couldn't be any more excited.
