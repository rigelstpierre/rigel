<p>This whole Amazon Fire has gone over much better than I think most people expected. They expected another sub par Android Tablet. What they got was a pretty good run a taking on and possibly creating an Android Market. The focus on this tablet seems to be entertainment. Reading books, watching tv and movies, and surfing the web (<a target="_blank" href="http://amazonsilk.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/introducing-amazon-silk/">clearly that was high on the list</a>). This is no iPad killer, it's at best an iPad competitor.</p>&#13;
<p>What I think amazon has done best here is keep simple. Really this seems like a MVP (minmum viable product), it's got the basics of what a tablet needs. It's done those things very well (on paper at least, no one has one or has reviewed it). It seems Amazon wanted to play in the tablet game before it was too late. Smart. They aren't shipping a crappy product or something sub par. They are shipping something that is basic, email, (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/09/28/amazon-fire-does-email-already-beats-rim/">take note RIM</a>), a media player a browser and a way to read books. It doesn't have a calendar or a way to take notes. It's simple. They'll ship something people will buy, listen to feedback, iterate, refine and ship an update or new tablet.</p>&#13;
<p>They've taken a solid OS, android 2.2, I do believe. Forked it and created there own OS. Some have called it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/tech-blog/why-kindle-fire-will-be-left-in-the-cold.html">Silk</a>. The thing that really is Silk is that cool(potential, pain staking) new browser. To speed up the process they are going to have some of the rendering and calls done in Amazon's Solid EC2. Again smart and really advanced technology(Google take note and give me this in chrome and Android.). </p>&#13;
<p>The only thing I can really hope for or feature request would be a better development environment. I've heard some stories of apps in the Amazon AppStore. You can't force Amazon to set a price. I think it's fine if you want to adjust the price but don't make the developer suffer take the hit just like in retail. </p>&#13;
<p>All in all I'm excited to get my hands on one of these. Not sure if I'd purchase one as I do heavily believe Amazon is deep into the next version. They need to be in order to stay competitive. Really it just makes everyone better. </p>&#13;
<p>EDIT: As pointed out by <a target="_blank" href="twitter.com/jglicksburg ">@jglicksburg </a> Not only does it look like Amazon is taking a stab at the iPad and tablet market  but looking to take on iTunes. This is very true. With actually devices Amazon is now creating an ecosystem. It would make sense to buy your music from Amazon if you were using one of their devices. Only time will tell on this front.</p>
