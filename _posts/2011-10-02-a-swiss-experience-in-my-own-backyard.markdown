Gais. A simple town about 20 minutes for St.Gallen. It's a quite peaceful village. I've grown to love this little place and have called it home for the past 7 weeks. When we came home from work on Thursday night it appeared that something was going to be happening our normally quite village, a fair perhaps?

It was Oktober Fest Gais. To be honest it has been one of my favorite things I've done in Switzerland. I drank, sang and danced until 2am just outside of the Falken, my home. It was awesome! The beer was amazing and came by the litre. I couldn't communicate with the people much more than and a cheer and a clink of the glass but it was great. We spoke the world language of "Beer".

If you ever plan on coming to Eupope come in Oktober and experience this tradition. I'm sure it runs deeper than my basic understanding but here is what Oktober Fest meant to me - Friends, Music, and Beer. Simple.
