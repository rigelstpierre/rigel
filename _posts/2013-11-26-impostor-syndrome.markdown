![Imposter Syndrome](/images/posts/impostor.jpg)

I recently posted that I had taken a new job with a compnay called Amco. I've now been with Amco for 3 months, and am extremly happy. We've just moved into an amazing new office, and the project I'm on is getting ready to start work on the next major version. The team is amazing and it's great to have a team to lean on when I've hit a road block.

Now with all this said I still feel out of place. I'm one of the engineers with the least experince on the team and the youngest employee of the company. I'm working with guys that have been working with Rails since 0.0.3. Often any moment I feel like my boss is going to call me into his office and ask me to pack my desk and leave. Until recently I had no way to discribe this feeling. While watching a talk by [Zach Holman][zachholman] I got a name for what I was feeling (and the image above) "Impostor Syndrome".

Everyday I'm being challenged with new tasks that make me really uncomortable. I know it's going to take me a few days to get this done while it might take one of the more senior devs a matter of hours or in worse case a day. Knowing this scares me. I often feel, and often am, having to BS my way through a meeting or call. Take the task, that makes me feel uncomfortable and figure out how to build it. Working with the other dev's help build it, and then open a PR. At this point I end up rewriting most of my code, learning a bunch and shipping my feature. I then rinse and repeat. I feel like an impostor.

I've tried to explain this feeling to my roommate, who works at Starbucks, my Project Manager and another Senior Developer. Most of the time they would say it's all going to be ok. It wasn't until I watched Zach's talk that I finally could really explain what I was feeling. I broguht the term to the above mentioned Senior Developer and he was that's exactly how he still feels to this day. This brought me some comfort. KKnowing I'm not the only one in the room that feels out of place is good, but what does that say about our company culture.

In my opion our companies culture, specifically the techincal team, is still figuing it's self out. The company is well estabilished in it's market, and were profitable. We are not a startup, but we kind of want that startup feeling. We want to expriment with new technoliges, drink beer on Fridays, and generally make work fun. I think something that's going to be key in that is curing Impostor Syndrome. A lot of that will come down to the indivual hired, but a lot of it will be the onboarding process, which (or lack there of) sucked for me. It took me almost a month and half to figure out what our company did. I've learned a lot about the company and can reflect on the experince. My hope when we hire next that I can help that person feel at home quicker than it took me. I'm not sure what that will look like and when our next hire might be, but I'll be sure to share the experince.

Until then, I do the best I can everyday. Working hard to overcome Impostor Syndrome, be more productive and be a better developer. Stuff like this may take months or years to finally be cured. I encourage you to watch Zach's talk. Really great to hear about how Github works and hires new people. It talks about way more than the problem I'm facing (this was one slide covered very quickly).
