<p>Today I'm excited to say that in a few weeks I'll be packing my bags and making the move to Switzerland to work with the highly talented team at <a title="Icon Worldwide" target="_blank" href="icon-worldwide.com">Icon Worldwide</a>, for 3 months. I couldn't be more excited and scared all at the same time. I've only been across the pond once before, I was 9 years old. </p>&#13;
<p>It's tough to be leaving an awesome community like Kelowna behind, but the chance to learn abroad I can't turn it down. I'd like to thank everyone for your support and the lessons and skills you've taught me.  While there you'll be able to get updates from this blog and <a href="http://icon-worldwide.com/blog/category/intern-blog/">here</a>. I can't wait to get there.  Stay tunned it's going to be an awesome ride!</p>
