I’ve been using Rdio since 2011. At the time I was living in Canada and Rdio was the only choice. Even with it being the only choice I learned to love it and even since moving to the states I’ve continued to use it. At first I used it in conjunction with iTunes, but earlier this year I decided to go all in with Rdio. I have about 20 albums in iTunes that I just can’t get on Rdio or any other streaming service. 

This week I wanted to shake things up and try out Spotify. Most of my twitter/online friends use Rdio but my “real life” friends use Spotify. I wanted to be able to see what they were listening to, and share what I was listening to. So far I’ve been pretty happy with Spotify, but it also has some major downfalls.

The big win are it’s iOS and Mac apps. Unlike Rdio’s mac app, Spotify is Native. It’s faster, has gapless playback, and just feels better in some places. The iOS is far snappier but what I miss the most is the idea of a collection, or library. Maybe I need to let go of the notion seeing as I own none of this music but when I don’t know what I want to listen I can browse through a list of music. It brings me back to the days when I would search through my CD case as kid, meticulously pick out a cd and place it in my Diskman. With Spotify you can see they want to be less like iTunes and be more like Pandora with the ability to listen to any song and more social features. The idea I need a playlist to sync a song offline is not one I want. I use playlists for building collections of songs I want to listen. Normally from different artists or sometimes genres. Being able to sync songs from my Mac/Web App on Rdio to my iPhone is a huge plus for me as well. 

After a week using Spotify as my primary music app, I’ve decided that I’m going to back to Rdio. Until my hand is forced it’s a really solid tool that for only $10/month you can’t go wrong with.
