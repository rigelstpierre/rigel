For some time now I've wanted a personal blog. To write about what I'm doing in my life, ideas I have and programming tips. Today I took the first step. I've started building sites using Rails in the past but the quickly become bloated and overkill. I feel that [Jekyll][jekyll] is going to work quite well for what I'm trying to do. 

Expect to see the design changing over the coming days. I'm excited about finally having this. It's been far too long.
