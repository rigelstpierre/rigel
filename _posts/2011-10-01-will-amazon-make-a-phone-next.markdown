My first reaction was maybe but after sleeping on it and giving it some thought I've come to the conclusion, No. Amazon is a content provider. They sell books, movies, tv shows, music and really anything else under the sun, but at their root they've always sold books. Selling an e-reader makes sense. It allows them to sell more books, easier and cheaper. For both them and the consumer.

I don't think a phone would fit into that model at all. Yes they may trying to make a <a target="_blank" href="http://thisismynext.com/2011/09/28/editorial-amazon-android-google/">pivot into a technology company</a>, but honestly sell a phone? I think that's real stretch for them. It doesn't really make sense, really the only reason they became a hosting company (which didn't fit into their original business model), was they were looking to make money off their by-product. They needed to create a solid system in order to host Amazon. Someone said "hmm, we've invested time and money into this. Their must be other people who need cloud services. Let's try and sell it" It worked. EC2 and S3 are 2 of the most widely used services across the web. I don't see a phone becoming a byproduct or a kindle or the new amazon fire.
