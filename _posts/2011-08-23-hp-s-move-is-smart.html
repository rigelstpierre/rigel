<p>When I heard what HP was doing with WebOS I was excited. As much as I love my iPhone and apple products having a product that competes is an awesome thing. It means both products (hopefully) get better. They are always trying to one up each other. Trying to be on top. The only real "Mac vs PC"  like batter we've seen in the mobile market is that of Android vs. iPhone, but there isn't a clear winner, unlike the PC and Mac world were PC still rules king. I really thought that HP would give both Google and Apple a run for their money, but again they had all the makings of a great OS but when it came to the hardware HP failed us and ultimately has failed its self. Now this post is not about what HP should have done, its about why I think what they are doing is an excellent move.</p>&#13;
<p>Although I'm sad for the future of WebOS whatever it may become, I'm excited to see such a major corporation realign it's self in a major way. They are simplifying what they do. They are pulling a "37 Signals" approach. They are seeing major changes in the consumer market. </p>&#13;
<p>We all know HP was/is all over the map. Enterprise, consumer, printers, and mobile, but they have refined it down to just Enterprise. They will be able to build better servers (in theory), provide better software and service to those enterprises. Now odds are I will never work or be one of HP Enterprise's customers, but one of the services I use might be. Maybe my hosting provider uses their servers. In directly I'm using HP hardware. If they are focusing to help them this should in theory make my experience better or not change which I'm ok with.</p>&#13;
<p>HP is not the only company to change focus. Apple has been doing this as well although not spending $10 billion dollars buying companies to do it, or being super vocal about it, but they are also making a ton of money compared to HP. They killed off the xserve as it wasn't part of there vision. They are focusing. It means the users of those products should and are better at the end of the day.</p>&#13;
<p>It will be interesting to watch the future of HP over the coming months, I'm saddened to see WebOS get thrown under the bus, it really is sad to see something so cool die. It could still come back on an HTC (which would be cool, they make cool hardware) or Samsung, as they may be treated as second class citizens in the new Motorola/Google world.</p>
