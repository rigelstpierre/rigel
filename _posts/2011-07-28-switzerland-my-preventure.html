<p>If there is anything I have learned in getting ready to travel to Switzerland for 3 months. DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT EVER EVER EVER EVER LOSE YOUR PASSPORT! Awhile ago I misplaced my passport. I didn't really think it was a big deal. I figured it would show up before I traveled next and all else failed I'd just get a new one reissued. Getting a new passport reissued in 10 days makes things interesting.</p>&#13;
<p>First you need to get a form, A Statuary Declaration, saying you lost your passport signed by a lawyer or a notary. Then refill out the passport form, which includes new photos. Take and then take said forms to the passport office. Now in most cases this is the end of the line. Not form me. You see my signature had evolved slightly in the 3 years since I got my drivers license and they wouldn't allow that signature. </p>&#13;
<p>I then had to go to ICBC and get a new drivers license. That was easy enough, went back to the passport office and now as of August 8th I will have a passport once more, just days before I travel. </p>&#13;
<p>So much left to do, move all my stuff to my parent's to store, replace my phone with an unlocked model, pack and get to the airport. As well I'm finishing off development on a series of PHP based calculators, an iPad app, a Website, starting work on the Eleet Systems brand, and a flash project. It's a lot of work to do in just 2 weeks! It scares me to think that this time 2 weeks from now I'll be a 10+ hour plane ride from my home.</p>
