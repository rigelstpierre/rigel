I like to conisder myself unique, some would call me a hipster. I embrass that term. I came up with this idea the other day after my co-worker asked me what a hipster is.

> "Hipster refers to a postmodern subculture of young, urban middle-class adults and older teenagers that first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[1] being derived from earlier movements in the 1940s." - [Wikipedia][wiki]

In high school, I defined myself as an emo. I wore skinny jeans (before they were "mainstream" cool), and band tees. I listened to My Chemical Romance, Stutterfly, Hawthorne Heights, Alexisonfire, and many more. My parents thought I was angry and maybe I was, but I found a group of people that I could relate too. We marched to beat of our drum. We didn't like the top 40's music. We were unique.

Fast forward a few years, you could label me a hipster. I listen to bands you've never heard of like Freelance Whales, Volcano Choir, and And So I Watch You From Afer. I like fitted hats, skinny jeans (the world came around), raw denim, and buttoning my shirt to the top. I like my coffee in certain ways. Some call this hipster, and maybe it is, but to me I'm just doing what I like.
