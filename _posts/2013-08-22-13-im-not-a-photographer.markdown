I would never call myself a photographer. I sometimes get a great photo on my iphone and with the right filter and editing I can get a decent photo. That said Monday I went jet skiing with a friend from Canada. It was a beautiful day, and I had to get a photo of the downtown skyline. I took it quickly as not to drop my phone in the water, and put it away.

Latter that day I edited it using VSCO Cam and it has turned out to be my favorite photo. You can see it see it below and I've attached a link to the [full size image][vsco_image].
