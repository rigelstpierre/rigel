<div id="home">
  <p>Hello, my name is Rigel St. Pierre. I'm a developer based in San Diego, CA. I specialize in Rails and Front End Development. Some people would call that a full stack developer but I like to call myself a User Experince Developer (UX Developer).</p>

  <p>When not writing code I can often be found behind the sound desk or mixing from my home studio. My inpiration comes from music and my faith. Quite often the two collide.</p>
