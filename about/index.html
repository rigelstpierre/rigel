  <p>Hello, my name is Rigel St. Pierre. I'm a developer based in San Diego, CA. I specialize in Rails and Front End Development. Some people would call that a fullstack developer but I like to call myself a User Experince Developer (UX Developer).</p>
  <p>I've worked with HTML5 and CSS3 as well as it's pre processors like SASS and HAML. Like any good developer I've also been around the block with Javascript, working with jQuery, Ember.js, Backbone.js and a very brief love afair with Batman.js. I like to write my javascript in coffeescript. My framework of choice these days is Ruby on Rails. It's robust, the community is great and I just plain like it. Also in my toolbox is Sinatra, Jeykll, and Wordpress. I'm not tied to any one platform. It's about choosing the right tool for the right project. A carpenter wouldn't use a saw to do a hammer's job.</p>
  <p>When not writing code I can often be found behind the sound desk or mixing from my home studio. My inpiration comes from music and my faith. Quite often the two collide.</p>
